A file is plain text. It begins with a front matter block between two `---` lines; keep it as it is. The body is Markdown: `#` headings, one line per paragraph, `- ` and `1. ` list items, `**bold**` and `*italic*`. Besides Markdown, only the tags described below exist; there are no other tags or attributes.

### Tables

A simple table is a pipe table: a header row, a delimiter row with one `---` per column, then one line per row; every row has one cell per column.

A table with any merged cell is written as `<table>` … `</table>` with one `<tr>` per line. Cells of the first row are `<th>`, the others `<td>`; an empty cell is `<td></td>`.

- `rowspan="N"`: the cell extends down over N rows. In the rows below, that cell is left out.
- `colspan="N"`: the cell extends right over N columns.
- A cell may have both. `<table>` and `<tr>` take no attributes, and cells take no others.

Every row covers the same number of columns as the first row: the cells written, plus their colspans, plus the cells still covered by a rowspan from above.

Example ("서울" covers two rows, "합계" covers two columns):

```
<table>
<tr><th>지역</th><th>지점</th><th>매출</th></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">서울</td><td>강남</td><td>120</td></tr>
<tr><td>종로</td><td>95</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">합계</td><td>215</td></tr>
</table>
```
